# DOM Atomic 05: Toggle Elements of DOM Path

> Describe the contract you used for finding the movies to toggle in the DOM. How is this function different from other functions that find elements in the DOM?

The strategy seems to be the same, its just finding the correct method to call upon the document to pick up classes within lists. It is different because it requires you to wrap your desired class within list tags...not sure if i am saying that correctly.
